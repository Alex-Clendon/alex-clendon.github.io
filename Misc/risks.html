<h1>Risks Cybercrime Poses to Healthcare.</h1>


</ul><h4><p>What are the risks posed to healthcare (attack types, previous examples, etc)<p></h4>

	<div class="row justify-content-center">
		<div class="col-5 shadow p-2 mr-1">
			<p class="text-justify">
				Healthcare is a fundamental piece of infrastructure in society, because of the role it plays in the welfare of people. Being in such a critical position consequently means that the sector constantly becomes a ripe target for exploitation by hackers.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				9 digits make a United States Social Security Number. With those 9 digits, a person's identity can be stolen and used to open new bank accounts, access medical care, and apply for credit cards. To not only have this number stolen but onsold to the highest bidder could cause an immense amount of destruction in a person's life. So when the same thing happens to 80 million people in a single data breach (BSI, 2015), or to the 422 million people caught up in data breaches each year (Petrosyan 2023), there is naturally some significant concern around the safety and protection of such information.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The exploitation of sensitive personal information can cause an extreme amount of harm, but it doesn't go as far as causing physical harm. However, to an opportunistic hacker who manages to disrupt the operations of healthcare services, whether that is by shutting down a hospital's network, or performing denial of service attacks against an important piece of medical software, real people can physically suffer. Delays are created and treatment can't be delivered to patients as quickly, less patients overall can be helped, and people in need of urgent care can go unattended.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The risk of physical harm as a result of cybercrime in healthcare spans far beyond hospitals though. People rely on a wide range of medical devices to assist them in life and commonly depend on them to survive. Implantable cardiac devices like pacemakers, insulin pumps, ventilators, and glucose monitoring systems all provide the consistent, ongoing care that so many people require. A slight configuration in the devices' settings by a hacker could cause a scarily huge range of health consequences. When lives are at risk there is no room for error, and without sufficient cybersecurity protection, the healthcare sector is a vulnerable fortress with open gates.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				In a video produced by Claroty, an American-based cybersecurity company with a substantial healthcare division, members of their cybersecurity research team known as “Team82” demonstrated their ability to hack into embedded medical devices such as an EKG patient monitor (Claroty, 2023). Team82 also postulated the idea that future cyberattacks made against the healthcare sector could shift from the “classical target” of digital patient health records and the systems in which such records are stored, to these embedded medical devices that are not typically thought of to professionals as the main target for threat actors (Claroty, 2023).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-5 shadow p-2">

			<p class="text-justify">
				The demonstration provides insight into how embedded devices such as the EKG can be reverse-engineered and exploited to display incorrect information such as patient vital signs. This sets a worrying precedent for two major reasons. Firstly, it shows in a real capacity the capability of threat actors to carry out attacks that put the wellbeing of patients into jeopardy, rather than the less immediate concerning (but not trivial) sensitive patient data. Secondly, it further elaborates on the ability of hackers to disrupt physical healthcare infrastructure through means of ransomware. This denies patient care and can lead to a lower chance of successful diagnosis/recovery.

			<p class="text-justify">
				During the emerging height of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in highly susceptible countries, medical ventilator devices were in incredibly short supply. It became a serious cause of concern considering that the shortage of ventilators was a consequence of the global reduction in manufacturing efforts brought on by the pandemic, their cost, and skyrocketing demand (Iyengar et al., 2020). Mortality rates for the infected in desperate need of critical invasive ventilation devices ranged between 77.1% and 88.4% for patients aged greater than 70-80 respectively (Santini et al., 2022). Given the fact that sources such as Claroty (2023) have demonstrated the ability to reverse engineer and abuse similar embedded medical devices, such attacks could potentially be performed on these life-sustaining technologies. They could be exploited to demand ransom at a time in which there is a higher chance of success due to the influx of patients placing strain on the healthcare system.

				From the findings produced by a report from Ponemon Institute (2022, pp. 3-6) titled “Cyber Insecurity in Healthcare: The Cost and Impact on Patient Safety and Care” consisting of responses from 614 surveyed IT and cybersecurity professionals within the healthcare sector (direct quotes from report):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					“Seventy-five percent of respondents say their organizations are vulnerable to a cloud compromise. In the past two years, 54 percent of respondents say their organizations
					experienced at least one cloud compromise. Organizations within this group experienced an
					average of 22 such compromises in the past two years.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					“Seventy-two percent of respondents believe their organizations are vulnerable
					to a ransomware attack. When asked what cybersecurity threats their organizations are most
					concerned about ransomware is the number one (60% of respondents). In the past two years,
					organizations that had ransomware attacks (41 percent of respondents) experienced an average of three such attacks.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					“Seventy-one percent of respondents say their organizations are vulnerable
					to a supply chain attack. Fifty percent of respondents say their organizations experienced at least one attack against the supply chain in the past two years. Organizations represented in this group had an average of four supply chain attacks in the past two years.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					“BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks encompass a wide range of impersonation tactics such as spoofing, phishing, and social engineering. Sixty-four percent of respondents say their organizations are vulnerable to a BEC incident. Fifty-one percent of respondents said they experienced at least one BEC incident in the past two years. Organizations in this group had an average of 3.5 BEC attacks in the past two years.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					(in relation to the previous findings):
					“Seventy percent of those respondents say it disrupted patient care. The consequences included the delay of procedures and tests that resulted in poor outcomes such as an increase in the severity of an illness (54 percent). Another consequence was a longer length of stay (51 percent). Twenty-three percent of respondents say there was an increase in mortality rate.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					“Sixty-seven percent of respondents say a BEC attack and/or a ransomware attack against their organizations disrupted patient care. Twenty-one percent of respondents say a BEC incident and 24 percent of respondents say ransomware increased the mortality rate.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					“Ransomware attacks are more likely than the other types of attacks to hurt patient safety and care delivery. Sixty-four percent of respondents in organizations that experienced a ransomware attack say it caused delays in procedures and tests that resulted in poor outcomes. Fifty-nine percent of respondents say it resulted in longer lengths of stay, which strains resources.”
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					“Negligent employees pose a significant risk to healthcare organizations. Fifty-nine percent
					of respondents say their organizations take steps to address the risk of employees' lack of awareness about cybersecurity threats, especially BEC. Of these respondents, 63 percent of respondents say they conduct regular training and awareness programs and 59 percent of respondents say their organizations monitor the actions of employees.”

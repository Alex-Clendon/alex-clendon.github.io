<h1>Cybercrime in the Healthcare Sector.</h1>


<h5><p>Why we have chosen this topic and why it has relevant implications for society.<p></h5>

<div class="flex-row">
	<div class="col-8">
		<p class="text-justify shadow p-2">
			Not everyone has a thorough understanding of cybercrime in the healthcare industry. Motivations for cybercrime against such organizations within the sector may seem vague or complex to fully comprehend beyond the obvious driving incentive of profit. In recent years, the healthcare sector has become increasingly vulnerable to cybercrime, posing significant risks to individuals and society as a whole. Cybercriminals target healthcare providers because of the abundance of sensitive patient information they possess as well as the critical nature of healthcare services. The healthcare industry and medical practices themselves have quickly adopted widespread digital services such as patient file databases and large-scale network infrastructures, which are designed to improve patient care through the use of more efficient systems. As a result, the industry has become a top target for bad actors looking to take advantage of the weaknesses in these systems for their own personal gain. 
			<br><br>
			Our intention for this project is to disseminate as much relevant information regarding this topic as possible. Readers should be better informed about the various forms of cybercrime that frequently affect the healthcare sector, the risks that attacks pose for society, the opportunities the topic presents to society (including what can be learned from previous cyberattacks, what can be done to prevent similar events in the future, etc.), and the decisions that the healthcare sector can make in order to effectively mitigate risks that have been identified, potentially through the opportunities that have been identified.

				Through what we have researched and learned in our project regarding cybercrime in healthcare, we have devised the following general recommendations that healthcare organisations should consider for strengthening cybersecurity and mitigating cybercrime. Of course, there are many nuances to the subject and plenty of technical suggestions that can be made for each specific area. Elaborating on such technical implementations would quickly exhaust the succinctness and concision of this project. However, these choices we have identified based on research and statistics gained from our sources aim to serve as general guides for what should be done by healthcare organisations, as well as other organisations within society to promote more robust and reliable cybersecurity as a whole.

				<strong>Investing in greater cybersecurity infrastructure:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The current status quo for healthcare providers is lacking and important decisions will need to be made in the future regarding the allocation of resources for greater cyber resilience. On average, healthcare providers only spend about 5% of their annual budget on cyber security (Ting, 2022). 64% argue that they are at risk of BEC (business email compromise) and phishing attacks. Only 48% of the identified providers say that they have adequate addressing and mitigation plans in place (Ting, 2022). Given the meteoric rise in the number of attacks against healthcare providers in recent years, and that according to Ting (2022), “Only 22% of IT managers in the healthcare industry feel that their organisation provides adequate funding for cybersecurity”, the sector is going to need to start spending more on their cybersecurity infrastructure to better protect against more sophisticated attacks.

				<strong>Staff training and awareness:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				There are conflicting estimates on the percentage of cyber security breaches caused by human error. Great strides have been made in recent years and through currently established better staff education the number has been reduced, but figures made by researchers at Stanford University still put the number to be somewhere around 88% (Altamura et al., 2023). A substantial number of employees still lack confidence in recognizing common social engineering cyber attacks that they would be susceptible to (phishing, BEC, spear phishing, etc), and confidence was even lower during the height of the pandemic due to high pressure and exhausted work environments (KnowBe4, 2021). If cybercrime in healthcare is to be more effectively mitigated in the future, efforts from staff in practising good cybersecurity will need to increase. 
				<br><br>
				Healthcare organisations need to foster a sense of cybersecurity culture, whereby cybersecurity awareness and accountability among employees become second nature. This would involve educating all employees on the value of cybersecurity, the typical threats targeted at their industry and especially the ones that less technical employees would be most susceptible to, and best practices of cybersecurity in the workplace for the continual integrity of their critical systems. In doing so; all employees gain valuable experience in safety and security in the systems that they are entrusted to use, patients will be prioritised as the sole focus of cybersecurity efforts among employees thereby increasing the relevance of upholding them, and the risk of successful cyberattacks will be greatly reduced.

				<strong>Implementing incident response plans:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Healthcare organisations should invest in cybersecurity infrastructure, as well as create and implement effective incident response plans. These plans lay out the actions that must be taken in the event of a cyberattack, ensuring a prompt and efficient reaction to lessen the harm and reduce downtime. Moreover, these plans should encompass distinct directives that cover breach detection and containment, notifying parties affected, carrying out forensic investigations, and restoring data and systems. Testing and simulation exercises should also regularly take place to evaluate the efficacy of such plans and ensure that they are readily deployable.

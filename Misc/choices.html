<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Reccomendations we have developed for healthcare organisations based on what we have researched.<p></h4>

			<p class="text-justify">
				Through what we have researched and learned in our project regarding cybercrime in healthcare, we have devised the following general recommendations that healthcare organisations should consider for strengthening cybersecurity and mitigating cybercrime. Of course, there are many nuances to the subject and plenty of technical suggestions that can be made for each specific area. Elaborating on such technical implementations would quickly exhaust the succinctness and concision of this project. However, these choices we have identified based on research and statistics gained from our sources aim to serve as general guides for what should be done by healthcare organisations, as well as other organisations within society to promote more robust and reliable cybersecurity as a whole.

				<strong>Investing in greater cybersecurity infrastructure:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The current status quo for healthcare providers is lacking and important decisions will need to be made in the future regarding the allocation of resources for greater cyber resilience. On average, healthcare providers only spend about 5% of their annual budget on cyber security (Ting, 2022). 64% argue that they are at risk of BEC (business email compromise) and phishing attacks. Only 48% of the identified providers say that they have adequate addressing and mitigation plans in place (Ting, 2022). Given the meteoric rise in the number of attacks against healthcare providers in recent years, and that according to Ting (2022), “Only 22% of IT managers in the healthcare industry feel that their organisation provides adequate funding for cybersecurity”, the sector is going to need to start spending more on their cybersecurity infrastructure to better protect against more sophisticated attacks. These attacks are only going to become stronger and more sophisticated as technology progresses, especially with the recent explosion of new revolutionary AI models and services. To keep up with this rise, healthcare organisations will need to begin increasing their average cybersecurity budget by 5% and begin hiring more cybersecurity professionals with greater experience.

			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Staff training and awareness:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				There are conflicting estimates on the percentage of cyber security breaches caused by human error. Great strides have been made in recent years and through currently established better staff education the number has been reduced, but figures made by researchers at Stanford University still put the number to be somewhere around 88% (Altamura et al., 2023). A substantial number of employees still lack confidence in recognizing common social engineering cyber attacks that they would be susceptible to (phishing, BEC, spear phishing, etc), and confidence was even lower during the height of the pandemic due to high pressure and exhausted work environments (KnowBe4, 2021). If cybercrime in healthcare is to be more effectively mitigated in the future, efforts from staff in practising good cybersecurity will need to increase. 
				<br><br>
				Healthcare organisations need to foster a sense of cybersecurity culture, whereby cybersecurity awareness and accountability among employees become second nature. This would involve educating all employees on the value of cybersecurity, the typical threats targeted at their industry and especially the ones that less technical employees would be most susceptible to, and best practices of cybersecurity in the workplace for the continual integrity of their critical systems. In doing so; all employees gain valuable experience in safety and security in the systems that they are entrusted to use, patients will be prioritised as the sole focus of cybersecurity efforts among employees thereby increasing the relevance of upholding them, and the risk of successful cyberattacks will be greatly reduced.

			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Ensuring adhesion to regulatory standards:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Standards are put in place for a reason, to protect both healthcare organisations and patients through the identified best practices within the industry. It is not enough for organisations to simply be mindful of their digital presence. Regulatory standards and frameworks provide greater protection and threat assessment against cyberattacks by implementing systems that have the greatest possible defence against said attacks. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework provide a cost-free solution to all public and private industries aimed at eliminating and managing cybersecurity threats (Chipeta, 2023). With the rapid evolution of the sophistication of attacks and the increase of scope, healthcare organisations will need to continually keep up to date with the latest regulatory standards and frameworks to ensure their continual security.

		<div class="col-3 shadow p-2 m-4">
			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Implementing incident response plans:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				As we mentioned, healthcare organisations should invest in cybersecurity infrastructure. But as well as this, it is also imperative that they create and implement effective incident response plans. These plans lay out the actions that must be taken in the event of a successful cyberattack, ensuring a prompt and efficient reaction to lessen the harm and reduce downtime that could result. Moreover, these plans should encompass distinct directives that cover breach detection and containment, notifying parties affected such as stakeholders, carrying out forensic investigations, and restoring data and systems. Testing and simulation exercises should also regularly take place to evaluate the efficacy of such plans and ensure that they are readily deployable. In doing so, the organisations can both identify and estimate the scope and potential damages suffered by the attacks as well outlining exact protocols that should be followed to provide the most cohesive and logical response. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-3 shadow p-2 m-4">
			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Collaborating with cybersecurity experts:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Healthcare organisations should consider partnering with third-party cybersecurity experts and consultants who specialize in the healthcare industry such as Clarorty, the well-established cybersecurity organisation mentioned in the risks page. These professionals can help with risk assessments, security audits, and the implementation of effective security measures potentially better than in-house contracted employees. They can also offer insightful advice on new and emerging threats facing similar organisations, and prevent attacks that have been made against their other clients by eliminating identified vulnerabilities. Healthcare organisations can improve their overall cybersecurity posture and stay one step ahead of cybercriminals by working together with skilled professionals.

			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Enhancing data encryption and access controls:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				To protect sensitive patient data, healthcare organisations must prioritize the implementation of strong data encryption and protected access controls. Encryption methods such as blockchain discussed on the opportunities page ensure that data remains secure even if it is intercepted by unauthorized individuals. Additionally, access controls should be implemented to restrict data access to authorized personnel only. Multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, and regular access reviews are some methods that can be employed to enhance data security within healthcare organisations. Such methods of encryption like blockchain will need to be designed and implemented such that they do not interrupt the function of the system they are safeguarding (such as making it impossible for a doctor to quickly view patient health records when necessary). If such recommendations are implemented, threat actors will have a much harder time accessing the information that they are attempting to procure and they will also be met with near-unbreakable encryption in the event of successful intrusion.

		<div class="col-3 shadow p-2 m-4">
			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Investing in threat intelligence and monitoring:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Healthcare organisations need to invest in robust and advanced threat intelligence and monitoring solutions to effectively detect and respond to cyber threats. Information about potential threats, such as newly discovered malware, hacking methods, and vulnerabilities, is gathered and analyzed through threat intelligence systems. Healthcare organisations can take proactive steps to fortify their defences and fend off potential attacks by staying informed about the most recent threats. Continuous monitoring of intra and inter-networks relevant to healthcare organisations and their systems can also help identify any suspicious activities or anomalies, allowing for prompt investigation and remediation if monitoring solutions detect an intrusion or attempted denial of service.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-3 shadow p-2 m-4">
			<p class="text-center">
				<strong>Establishing partnerships and information sharing:</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				It will be mutually beneficial for organisations to form partnerships and take part in information-sharing initiatives given the interconnectedness of the healthcare sector. The sharing of threat intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned through case studies can be facilitated by cooperative efforts with other healthcare providers, governmental organisations, cybersecurity organisations, and law enforcement. Healthcare organisations can collectively strengthen their cybersecurity defences and react to cyber threats more effectively by pooling resources and expertise. This could be facilitated by a sort of private association where organisations could join and collectively share resources pertinent to advancing their cybersecurity efforts. This could include things previously mentioned such as regulating and standardising the frameworks healthcare organisations would use for both incident response and prior to this, threat protection.

	<div class="row justify-content-center">
		<div class="col-8 shadow p-2">
			<p class="text-justify">
				In conclusion, healthcare organizations need to make crucial decisions to bolster their defence against cybercrime. Choices and recommendations that we have identified that have the potential to strengthen cybersecurity efforts in the sector include investing in cybersecurity infrastructure, providing staff training and awareness and promoting a culture of cybersecurity, adhering to regulatory standards, implementing incident response plans, collaborating with cybersecurity experts, enhancing data encryption and access controls, investing in threat intelligence and monitoring, and establishing partnerships for information sharing. By taking a proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, healthcare organisations can better protect sensitive patient data and ensure the continuity of critical healthcare services in the coming years of technological progress.

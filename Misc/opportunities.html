<h1>Opportunities for Cybersecurity in Healthcare</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Opportunities for the healcare industry against cybercrime.<p></h4>

			These Health records are low risk and high reward targets for criminals which further encourages them to perform these attacks.This holds a great deal of valuable confidential data that the criminal could sell them in the black market in exchange for money, and there is little chance of those responsible being caught. These attacks can be from emails that are infected with malware, to ransomware, to DDoS attacks, etc. The criminal groups update their methods to infiltrate into the database on a regular basis. Many of these attacks are happening due to the Healthcare being outdated with their network security system, bad encryption, untrained staff just to mention a few. While cyberattacks pose significant risks, there are also opportunities for the healthcare sector to enhance its capabilities and improve patient outcomes by addressing and mitigating these threats. It is crucial to inform employees on typical attack vectors, including malware, viruses, email attachments, web pages, pop-ups, instant chats, and text messages, as well as how to spot strange activity that is happening within the system. 
			<br><br>
			The detriment of cyber attacks to not only the healthcare sector's functional but also reputational status cannot be overstated. That being said, there is much that can be learned from previous events and from researching the factor of human non-infallibility. Human error caused by staff accounts for many of the cybersecurity threats targeted at healthcare organisations (Jyri Rajamäki et al., 2018). It is important to address these problems, as it allows for the opportunity for better education and digital literacy to become commonplace to non-IT staff. In recent years better methodologies and paradigms are being developed with the intention of providing such training to staff to reduce the risk of future cyber security threats. Examples of this can be are already being produced in publications, such as the exploration of the “proactive resilience educational framework” which aims to provide a “holistic cyber resilience and security framework for developing and delivering a multilateral educational and training scheme based on a proactive approach to cybersecurity.” under the guiding principles of being “interactive, guided, meaningful and directly relevant to the user's operational environment” (Jyri Rajamäki et al., 2018).
			<br><br>
			Through developing and implementing better staff training on cybersecurity practices, both system integrity and reputation can be ensured. This is a benefit to both patients requiring trust in the healthcare system to provide them with the uninterrupted and adequate care they need, as well as all employees of healthcare organisations to extinguish potential harm that could be brought upon patients.
			<br><br>
			As well as this, there is the potential for new technologies to assist in all industries in the pursuit of greater cyber security, especially healthcare. Blockchain is an emerging technology that centres around using cryptographic encryption processes to store information. According to IBM (2023), the core premise of the technology revolves around all participants of the blockchain having access to a decentralised ledger containing the relevant information regarding the assets it stores. Information stored in the blockchain is unchangeable, once something has been added to the blockchain, a permanent record is kept of it. This ensures that threat actors that wish to alter or change information are simply unable to, given the cryptographic encryption measures that are essentially impossible to break. If a change or error is detected within the blockchain ledger, a new change is automatically applied to the ledger to reverse the error IBM (2023). The nuances of blockchain are still not very well understood by the general population due to its rapid adoption in certain fields and even faster evolution. However, the potential benefits it could provide to cybersecurity, particularly within the healthcare sector could be significant.

			Potential benefits that blockchain technology could provide to healthcare cybersecurity that have been identified include:
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Storing individual patient data records; including but not limited to results from medical tests, current treatment plans, all patient credentials, and other potentially sensitive information (Haleem et al., 2021).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Unified storage of health records. This would allow healthcare providers to maintain a greater understanding of a patient's health status at any given time by collecting legitimate records from multiple potential past providers (Haleem et al., 2021). This would also have the added benefit of deterring threat actors from targeting organizations with fewer resources dedicated to digital health record security.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Storing individual patient data records; including but not limited to results from medical tests, current treatment plans, all patient credentials, and other potentially sensitive information (Haleem et al., 2021).
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			The potential applications of blockchain technology to cybersecurity practices in the healthcare sector are limitless. Many potential threats such as database intrusions and sensitive data being exploited to carry out further attacks (such as denial of service and ransomware), could be mitigated through the highly secure nature of blockchain technology.

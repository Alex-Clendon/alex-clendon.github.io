		<td> <em>An in-depth look into cyber crime that occurs in the healthcare sector; giving insight into the types of attacks, motives behind said attacks, and the groups and individuals responsible. Our project aims to analyse the extent of cyber attacks commonly carried out against healthcare organisations, the impact on patient care and well-being they have, and broader societal aspects that result from them. <br><br>We have chosen to investigate cybercrime in the healthcare sector due to the relevance and implications it poses as a societal threat. The healthcare sector is a critical infrastructure in society that also handles very sensitive information. The potential consequences of successful cyber attacks against healthcare organisations include compromised patient safety and well-being, financial loss, and detriment to the publicâ€™s trust in the healthcare system.
